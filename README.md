# Polyhedral theory for mathlib

The goal of this project is to provide a flexible and useful implementation of polyhedral geometry/combinatorics in Lean, for `mathlib`, on which more advanced theory can be built. Currently we focus on polyhedral cones since convexity on affine spaces is not yet well developed in mathlib. There is a clear plan for how to move to polyhedra and polytopes eventually. To get to a point where we can implement and work with polyhedral cones comfortably, we also needed to implement duality theory, faces of cones and many more details.

See also the [Zulip discussion](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/116395-maths/topic/Polyhedra.20in.20mathlib/with/579450695) on the topic.

Currently the project implements:
* co-finitely generated submodules (`CoFG`)
* duality for submodules w.r.t. a general bilinear pairing.
* dual closed subspaces (`DualClosed`) which expresses that a subspace is its own double dual.
* `DualFG` submodules, which are the dual of `FG` (finitely generated) submodules.
* duality theory for `FG` submodules
* dual closed pointed cones
* `DualFG` pointed cones
* duality theory for `FG` pointed cones, in particular, a version of the Minkowski-Weyl theorem that works to infinite dimensional modules.
* polyhedral cones as cones that can be written as the sum of an `FG` cone and a submodule.
* duality theory of polyhedral cones
* faces and exposed faces of cones
* the face lattice of a cone
* face theory of polyhedral cones (all faces are exposed, the face lattice is graded, etc.)
